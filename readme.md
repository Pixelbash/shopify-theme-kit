# Use your favourite tools
This workflow is designed to let you use gulp to automate as much of the fiddly stuff involved in editing shopify themes as possible. It comes with tools from my workflow like less and es6 but it is easy to swap these out if needed.

Checkout the grunt branch to see the old workflow, I never could get it to work right though.
