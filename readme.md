# Use your favourite tools
This workflow is designed to let you use gulp to automate as much of the fiddly stuff involved in editing shopify themes as possible. It comes with tools from my workflow like less and es6 but it is easy to swap these out if needed.

The master branch is an older workflow that used grunt, I could never get it to work right. gulp branch is the latest and greatest.
